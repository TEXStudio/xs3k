About
-----
X-Sledding 3000 is a cross-platform 3d racing game.
The game data files are compressed and placed under the bin directory
(data.tar.gz). In order to play the game, you need to uncompress
the data file and place the contents under the same directory as the 
executable. You will also need the cg and fmodex dll files if you don't 
already have the related libraries installed in your system.

If you want a precompiled package, with all dependencies included
you can grab it here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/60120442/demo/xs3k.zip

 * MS Windows
 * Playstation 3

Due to the NDA, we had to remove the PS3 source code
before releasing the game as open-source.

Place the files under the directory dep in the root of the
